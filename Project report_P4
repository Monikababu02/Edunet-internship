Human Pose Estimation: Overview
Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a computer vision task that predicts the keypoints (joints) of a human body from an image or video. It is widely used in applications such as action recognition, augmented reality, healthcare monitoring, and sports analytics.

Types of Pose Estimation
2D Pose Estimation: Detects keypoints in a 2D image (e.g., OpenPose, PoseNet).
3D Pose Estimation: Predicts keypoints in 3D space (e.g., MediaPipe, HRNet).

Single-Person vs Multi-Person Pose Estimation:
Single-Person: Detects keypoints for one person.
Multi-Person: Detects multiple people and assigns keypoints correctly.

Popular Human Pose Estimation Models

OpenPose (by CMU): Detects multiple persons' keypoints in real-time.
PoseNet (by Google): Lightweight model for mobile applications.
HRNet: High-resolution deep learning model for accurate keypoint detection.
MediaPipe (by Google): Real-time pose estimation framework.
